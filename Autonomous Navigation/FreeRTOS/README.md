FreeRTOS open source libraries can be utilized to run multiple task simultaneously on a micro-controller.

Here, We have run the following tasks in parallel on Arduino Uno board.

* Blinking an LED connected to pin 13.
* Varying the speed of motor (connected via L293D motor driver IC) from zero to full speed and vice versa in a loop.
