ESP32 is among the popular micro-controllers. The ESP32 series utilizes Tensilica's Xtensa LX6 microprocessor, or the Xtensa LX7 dual-core microprocessor or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor. It includes built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. Unlike Arduino Uno it provide on-board WiFi and Bluetooth functionalities. It supports various interfaces such as SD card, UART, SPI, I2C, LED/Motor PWM module, GPIO, IR, ADC/DAC, etc. It operates on voltage supply of 3-3.6V. It is a successor to the ESP8266 micro-controller.

\subsection{Vaman Pygmy BB4} 
\par Vaman is a development board based around the Pygmy Stamp module, and brings on-board WiFi/BT/BLE connectivity with ESP32, as well as an 18650 battery option, $\mu$SD Card (connected to ESP32), possibility to use EOSS3 in smartphone mode with the ESP32 as the Host, and all EOSS3 pins accessible. A BMX160 provides an AMG IMU, supplemented by a BNO055 smart fusion sensor. A DPS310 provides Pressure, Humidity and Temperature monitoring.

\subsection{Arduino Uno}  

\par Arduino is an open-source development board ideal for handling a variety of applications. It is inexpensive as well as feature-packed. It is compatible with a variety of daughter boards that can be attached to it.  The low-power Bluetooth shield, along with the Wi-Fi and Ethernet shields, allows increased communication functionalities.

\par Raspberry Pi (RPi) is an on-board computer and it is among the most popular development boards. The Raspberry Pi runs a customized version of Linux called Raspberry Pi OS. It has all the features of a personal computer. This board has USB interfaces that allow it to connect to peripherals (such as a mouse and keyboard), USB storage, etc. HDMI interface can be used to connect displays to the board having up to 4K resolution. Additionally, it has other ports/interfaces, including USB-C (power), a 2-lane MIPI CSI port (camera), a 3.5mm audio jack (audio), and RJ-45 (Ethernet). WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0 support are provided by the Raspberry Pi.
