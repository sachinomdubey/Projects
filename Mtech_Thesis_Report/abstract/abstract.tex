\par This report is intended to serve as a concise and to-the-point report of my work in the domain of autonomous navigation of UGVs (Unmanned Ground Vehicles) and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). A driver or operator is generally required to operate a ground vehicle (car, bus, etc.) or an aerial vehicle (quad-copter, etc.). These operators/drivers must be trained, and obtaining a license is also a tedious process (especially for aerial vehicles). In reality, these factors prevent us from utilizing these machines to their full potential and exploring their wide array of valuable applications.
\par By automating ground vehicles, we could save on fuel, reduce accident-related costs, and improve overall transportation efficiency. An autonomous aerial vehicle, on the other hand, can be used for many purposes, including: Food and medical delivery in remote areas, Public safety in calamities, Bridge and power lines inspection, Agriculture, Road accident report, Traffic monitoring, and Transportation.
\par This report presents implementation of various application of UGV/UAV kit which forms a base for more complex autonomous navigation application.
