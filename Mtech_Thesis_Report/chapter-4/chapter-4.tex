    values.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Working}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User first arms the drone using Yaw and Throttle slider (analogous to arming using fly-sky transmitter) and slowly increase the throttle slider to lift the drone vertically from the ground.
    \item Whenever a slider is changed by user the ESP32 reads this change and generates a PWM signal (same as generated by the Fly-sky receiver module).
    \item Depending on the duty-cycle of this signal the APM controller drives the four ESC modules which further controls the speech of the four BLDC motors. (Refer section \ref{Basics_motor_control} for details on control of speed of BLDC motors)
    \item Thus, the Android phone and ESP32 form a new communication link from ground operator to drone controller. The range of this link is limited by the Wi-Fi network to which the ESP32 and android phones are connected.

\section{Basic programs using FreeRTOS}

Embedded systems uses real-time operating system. Real-time tasks are critical as timing places an important role in such systems. RTOS are made to run tasks or program with precise timings and high degree of reliability. It helps in multitasking even when the micro-controller unit has a single core to execute these tasks.

FreeRTOS is an open source RTOS which are designed, but not limited to run on small micro-controllers (8/16 bit). With basic knowledge of RTOS, we can use FreeRTOS as there is a lot of documentation available for it.

\subsection{Running two tasks simultaneously using FreeRTOS (Arduino) }

In this program, we have run two different tasks in parallel on Arduino Uno using FreeRTOS. The two tasks are as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Blinking LED connected at pin 13 of Arduino.
    \item Speeding up and slowing down a DC motor continuously in a loop.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Required components/Software tools}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Arduino Uno R3 board
    \item LED connected between pin 13 and GND.
    \item L293D motor driver IC
    \item 12V DC Battery for motor
    \item Type-B cable for powering Arduino
    \item Jumper Wires
    \item Arduino IDE installed on system
\end{itemize}

\caption{Wiring diagram for running two tasks simultaneously on Arduino Uno.}
\label{Wiring_FreeRTOS_demo}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Steps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make the connections as per the wiring diagram (Figure \ref{Wiring_FreeRTOS_demo}).
    \item Connect the Arduino Uno to Laptop/PC using Type-B USB cable.
    \item Open the program at the code link (\ref{Code_link_FreeRTOS_Arduino}) in Arduino IDE.
    \item From Tools menu, select suitable ”Board” and ”Port” for your Arduino board.
    \item Compile the code by clicking on ”Verify” option.
    \item Upload the code to ESP32 using the ”Upload” option.
    \item Verify that the LED blinks and the motor also changes speed simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Working}
\begin{itemize}
    \item First the FreeRTOS library is included using the below line. This header contains all the functions required to create, schedule and run tasks in parallel.
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
    #include <Arduino_FreeRTOS.h>
    \end{lstlisting}
    \item For creating task, \textbf{xTaskCreate()} API is called in setup function with certain parameters/arguments.
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
    xTaskCreate( TaskFunction_t pvTaskCode, const char * const pcName,
    uint16_t usStackDepth, void *pvParameters, UBaseType_t uxPriority,
    TaskHandle_t *pxCreatedTask );
    \end{lstlisting}
    \item There are 6 arguments that should be passed while creating any task. Let’s see what these arguments are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{pvTaskCode}: It is simply a pointer to the function that implements the task (in effect, just the name of the function).
        \item \textbf{pcName}: A descriptive name for the task. This is not used by FreeRTOS. It is included purely for debugging purposes.
        \item \textbf{usStackDepth}: Each task has its own unique stack that is allocated by the kernel to the task when the task is created. The value specifies the number of words the stack can hold, not the number of bytes. For example, if the stack is 32-bits wide and usStackDepth is passed in as 100, then 400 bytes of stack space will be allocated (100 * 4 bytes) in RAM. Use this wisely because Arduino Uno has only 2Kbytes of RAM.
        \item \textbf{pvParameters}: Task input parameter (can be NULL).
        \item \textbf{uxPriority}: Priority of the task ( 0 is the lowest priority).
        \item \textbf{pxCreatedTask}: It can be used to pass out a handle to the task being created. This handle can then be used to reference the task in API calls that, for example, change the task priority or delete the task (can be NULL).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example of task creation
    \begin{lstlisting}
    xTaskCreate(task1,"task1",128,NULL,1,NULL);
    xTaskCreate(task2,"task2",128,NULL,2,NULL);  
    \end{lstlisting}
    \item After creating the task, start the scheduler in a void setup using \textbf{vTaskStartScheduler()} API.
    \item \textbf{Void loop()} function will remain empty as we don’t want to run any task manually and infinitely. Because task execution is now handled by Scheduler.
    \item Next we define our tasks using below format and write logic for it. Everything else is taken by FreeRTOS library function and we can observe the tasks running in parallel on executing the written program.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    void task1(void *pvParameters)  
    {
        while(1) {
            ..
            ..//your logic
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
